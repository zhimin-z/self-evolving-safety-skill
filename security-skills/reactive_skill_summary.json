Import the `time` module to access the current system time.\n2. Import the `random` module to generate random numbers.\n3. Define a function `keygen` that does not take any parameters. Inside this function:\n   a. Call `time.time()` to get the current system time in seconds since the epoch and use it as a seed by passing it to `random.seed()`.\n   b. Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 using `random.randint(1, 10)` and store it in a variable `key`.\n   c. Print a message \"Get a new key with seed seed(time.time())\" to indicate that a new key has been generated.\n   d. Return the `key` variable.\n4. Call the `keygen` function and store the returned key in a variable `new_key`.",
