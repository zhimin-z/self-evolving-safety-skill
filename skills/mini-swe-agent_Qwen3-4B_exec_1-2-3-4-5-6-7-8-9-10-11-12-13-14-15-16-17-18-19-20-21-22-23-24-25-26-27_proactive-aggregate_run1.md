**Security Skill: Proactive Malicious Code Defense**  

## Overview  
This skill proactively blocks malicious code execution by checking for specific patterns in the code, such as targeting specific URLs, reading system files, using certain functions, and setting specific headers. It enforces a strict binary refusal policy for harmful requests, ensuring no code is executed even in modified form.  

## Technical Countermeasures
